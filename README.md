# Project Spark: Welcome to Solar Search!

To follow in the footsteps of the people who have thought about our place in the world for millennia, use the planet icons to get clues for the location of "planet trackers" in the gallery. When you find the tracker, scan it with the app, find the answer to the question presented in the content nearby, and choose the answer to collect the planet. As you go, you can view all of the planets you've collected in the solar system by going to the Cave under the start of the stream and scanning the Solar System tracker there.
