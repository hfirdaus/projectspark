      "location": "South Wall of Gallery",
      "answers": [
        "Curtains of Light",

        "Equatorial Lights",
        "Boreal Light Show"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Aurora Borealis",
      "reason": "Auroras are named after the Roman goddess Aurora who heralded the coming of the sun from east to west, and Borealis refers to the north. This is why the Aurora Borealis is also called the Northern Lights."

        "Nitrogen scatters blue light",
        "Brillouin scattering",
        "Raman scattering",
        "Compton scattering"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Nitrogen scatters blue light",
      "reason": "This phenomena is called Rayleigh scattering, because blue light scatters more it can be seen from many angles here on Earth so most of the time the sky looks blue. During sunset, the angle of the sun to our eyes is more direct, so the sky can look red or orange because that red light is making its way to us."

      "location": "West Wall of Gallery",
      "correct_answer": "A collision with an asteroid, meteorite, or comet",
      "reason": "The collisions were so powerful and strong that they sent shockwaves through the Moon’s surface. These waves created craters with ripples, like in water!"

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Away from the sun",
      "reason": "You can tell it’s facing away from the sun because Curiosity’s self-portrait is of its shadow!"

      "question": "Neptune and Uranus are called \"ice giants\" because they have mantles of water, ammonia and methane in a dense fluid instead of gas - even though that wouldn't seem much like ice to us! Here in Calgary, we used to be covered in a glacier, and then a lake -- what was the depth of the \"icy ocean\" over us?",
